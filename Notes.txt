Notes:
    Helper class contains all methods bot needs to interact with server
    Certain parts of server needs to call methods from DiscordBot, those are below

1. Linking in-game accounts
    To begin linking in-game accounts, user needs to do command .link within certain discord channel
    User will be PMed instructions, with a random string
    User does command ::verify (random_string) on server
    Server calls boolean Links.linkDiscordAccount(username, random_string)
    Boolean returns true if account gets linked, false otherwise

    Once account is linked, bot will use getRole command in helper
    This needs to return the id of the role to give to user
    (For donator statuses, mod ranks, etc)

    TODO: methods to access linked accounts
    TODO: way to view and retrieve role ids (just a command that pms owner prob)

2. Linking in-game friends chat
    An admin must do this, as a channel in the discord must be added as well
    Once added, go to that channel and do the command .link-chat (friends_chat)
    (friends_chat) being the username of the owner

    A method is set up in Helper for when a user types in a linked discord channel
    This method should then send the message to the friends chat, if it exists
